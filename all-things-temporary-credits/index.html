			Lyrics<br><br>

			Brace for your spell and your apparel<br> 
	        Warm up my shirt like air of a tea <br>
			Rain pulls my hair If you're with me, I'm indifferent <br>
			You're sharing my breath, so I don't mind  <br><br>
			
			I can't see light <br>
			Now only reflex <br>
			Finding my way throughout your frame<br>
			Inscribe my neck <br>
			If you scar me, I'm indifferent <br>
			The purple hue affirms our youth  <br><br>

			Although I don't want to leave the room <br>
			Or do more than sleep around with you <br>
			When the lights are turned on, I am just the fool I was <br>
			So let's keep them off

			Lyrics<br><br>

			I'm nomadic for now  <br><br>

			I'll have you know that when summer comes  <br>
			I'm afriad that you'll never see your friends  <br>
			They won't come with us  <br>
			But maybe we can go to Paris though  <br>
			Try to forget that you'll never see your home  <br>
			Flights are booked let's go   <br><br>

			Well you can take me  <br>
			Out of my city but I won't change  <br>
			I won't change   <br>
			I'm just nomadic for now   <br><br>

			Hotel feels like I'm royalty  <br>
			But stay inside because the subway's closed tonight  <br>
			Bomb threats shut our eyes   <br>
			But I can't focus  <br>
			My mind is pre-occupied by the images of my friends  <br>
			When I said I left   <br>
			I'm just nomadic for now  <br>
			<br>
			I can't take it  <br>
			The war I just witnessed <br>
			It clutters my head  <br>
			Is this all I get  <br>
			It's been months  <br>
			Without acquaintances I think I left <br>
			My heart in Boston  <br>
			Is this all I get<br>

			Lyrics<br>
			<br>
			Can you hear me? <br>
			I never learned your name till it was painted with flames <br>
			I'm told I'll see you again <br>
			But if this is the end, tell me if you would say  <br>
			That nothing really matters <br>
			Nothing really matters<br>
			<br>
			Have you found what you needed? <br>
			Are the gates so glistening and painted with gold? <br>
			Would you say that the classroom desks resemble the throne? <br>
			'Cause your friend burst in tears when he saw yours alone  <br>
			<br>
			Would you say that nothing really matters? <br>
			Nothing really matters  <br>
			Nothing really matters <br>
			Nothing really matters   <br>
			<br>
			I hope I see you in heaven  <br>
			<br>
			I liked your sister's speech <br>
			I couldn't help but see her as my own <br>
			The way that she said she'd help you pick out your clothes  <br>
			Or when she's off to college you'd hang out in her room <br>
			Made it sound like you were in heaven on earth <br>
			Didn't get it, why'd you go to the real one? <br>
			To the real one <br>
			Made us all in heaven on earth I don't get it, why'd you go to the real one? <br>
			To the real one  <br>
			<br>
			I hope I see you in heaven<br>
			<br>
			I pray that you find the peace that you're looking for <br>
			Rain from your headache stops seeping under the door <br>
			Last time I saw you was in the back of a Cadillac <br>
			I turned my back, walked away <br>
			Please don't let it be the last time <br>
			Don't let it be the last time

			Lyrics<br><br>
			Take me home <br>
			I'm tired of seeing you wherever I go <br>
			You're my ghost  <br>
			<br>
			I woke up in my old bedroom again <br>
			Until I turned on the lights <br>
			Same bed, same pictures on the wall <br>
			But the windows tell it all I'm not home  <br>
			<br>
			When December came <br>
			And I walked outside <br>
			My arms couldn't tell a difference <br>
			If I closed my eyes <br>
			Well, my nose ain't broken <br>
			It'll red like it used to <br>
			But I know I'm not used to <br>
			All that's changed  <br>
			<br>
			If it's the board I miss <br>
			Or it's Sarah's kiss <br>
			It all blends in anyway <br>
			I never get it my way  <br>
			Take me home <br>
			I'm tired of seeing you wherever I go<br>
			You're my ghost  <br>
			<br>
			Friday came along <br>
			I made a date with new towers <br>
			I thought I'd part with old flowers <br>
			You really think I would change?<br>
			I'm in between cars again <br>
			I can't find past adrenaline <br>
			I guess I'll drive myself home <br>
			Alone now  <br>
			<br>
			If it's the board I ride <br>
			Or I'm just filled with pride <br>
			It all blends in anyway <br>
			I never get it my way  <br>
			<br>
			Take me home <br>
			I'm tired of seeing you wherever I go <br>
			You're my ghost  <br>
			The sky opens too wide<br>
			Your silhouette doesn't dip into it <br>
			Any more <br>
			<br>
			I'll come back <br>
			If I'm dead if I have to <br>
			I'll never escape you <br>
			Though you won't chase me back<br>

			Lyrics<br>
			<br>
			You, you're in everything <br>
			I didn't think I'd graduate before you came around  <br>
			I'm glad you made an appearance <br>
			I thought I'd never see your face til mine was in the ground  <br>
			<br>
			But I saw your apparition <br>
			The same way I saw my body on pavement  <br>
			In the painting of my windshield <br>
			When bullet rain hits my car <br>
			At eighty miles an hour <br>
			That's where you are   <br>
			<br>
			I have waited for so long <br>
			For consolation for my aching heart  <br>
			I'm sorry I thought you were absent <br>
			I thought that you stayed along back with my friends at home  <br>
			<br>
			But I saw  your apparition <br>
			The same way I saw my body on pavement  <br>
			In the painting of my windshield <br>
			When bullet rain hits my car <br>
			At eighty miles an hour <br>
			That's where you are   <br>
			<br>
			And through the all I'm scared that you won't like me <br>
			Just tell me please <br>
			Will I ever be sure <br>
			That I'm not just crazy  <br>
			Cause they call me insane <br>
			But I'll stay with you <br>
			But will you stay with me <br>
			<br>
			Cause I saw  your apparition <br>
			The same way I saw my body on pavement  <br>
			In the painting of my windshield <br>
			When bullet rain hits my car <br>
			At eighty miles an hour <br>
			That's where you are<br>
